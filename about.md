Hi, my name is Erik Ejlskov Jensen. My profile name on [GitHub](https://github.com/ErikEJ) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ErikEJ) is ErikEJ.

I am a Developer Technologies (former Microsoft Data Platform) Microsoft MVP, .NET and Data Access Developer and Entity Framework expert.

I work as Principal Specialist at [delegate](https://delegate.dk/) where I help customers create and improve cloud solutions.

You can learn more about my open source tools and libraries for EF Core on [my presentation web site](https://erikej.github.io/EFCorePowerTools/index.html)

I also have a number of open source tools and libraries for working with SQLite and SQL Server Compact, get an [overview here](http://erikej.github.io/SqlCeToolbox/)

My old blog, which still has a lot of useful content, in particular on SQL Server Compact, is [available here](https://erikej.blogspot.com/)
