Hi, my name is Erik Ejlskov Jensen.

I am a Data Platform (and now Developer Technologies) MVP, .NET and Data Access Developer. 

I work as Cloud Data & DevOps Specialist at [Cloudeon.com](https://www.cloudeon.com) 

You can learn more about my tools and libraries for EF Core on [my presentation web site](https://erikej.github.io/EFCorePowerTools/index.html)

I also have a number of tools and libraries for working with SQLite and SQL Server Compact, get an [overview here](http://erikej.github.io/SqlCeToolbox/)
