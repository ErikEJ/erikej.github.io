Keeping your SQL database project in sync with a live database is one of the most common — and most tedious — challenges in database development. If you have ever manually compared `CREATE TABLE` scripts line by line, or tried to figure out which stored procedures drifted out of sync between your source code and development or production environments, **Visual Schema Compare** was built for you.

## What is Visual Schema Compare?

Visual Schema Compare is a built-in feature of the [SQL Database Project Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.SQLProjectPowerTools) Visual Studio extension. It surfaces the full power of the [Microsoft DacFx](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-applications) schema comparison engine — the same engine used by SQL Server Data Tools — directly inside Visual Studio, in a purpose-built tool window.

With a single right-click on your database project, you can:

- Compare your **project** against a **live database** to see what has drifted
- Compare a **live database** against your **project** to see what your project is missing
- Review **per-object T-SQL diffs** side by side
- Copy the **generated deployment script** ready for review or execution

No extra tooling, no manual diffing, and no leaving Visual Studio.

## Why You Need This

### The Problem: Schema Drift

Even with a database project in source control, schemas drift. A hotfix goes directly to production, a developer makes a change in their local environment but forgets to commit the SQL script, or an ORM migration runs against a shared database. Over time, the gap between what is in the project and what is in the database grows — and at some point you need to reconcile them.

Traditional approaches involve:

- Exporting scripts and doing a file diff
- Writing your own comparison queries against `sys.objects`

None of these fit naturally into a code-first database development workflow.

### The Solution: Visual Schema Compare

Visual Schema Compare gives you a first-class schema diff experience without leaving your development environment.

## Key Capabilities

- **Project-to-database and database-to-project comparison** – Choose which side is the source and which is the target, covering both deployment and reverse-engineering scenarios.
- **Side-by-side T-SQL diffs** – Selecting any row in the differences grid renders the source and target T-SQL definitions side by side, powered by [DiffPlex](https://github.com/mmanela/diffplex), so you can immediately see what changed.
- **Actionable differences grid** – The grid shows the object name, object type, difference type (Added, Deleted, Changed), and the update action DacFx recommends.
- **Deployment script generation** – DacFx generates a full T-SQL deployment script for the detected differences. You can copy it to the clipboard and use it for manual review, peer review, or execution in your own pipeline.
- **Async comparison** – The comparison runs asynchronously so Visual Studio stays responsive while DacFx processes large schemas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (any edition)
- [SQL Database Project Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.SQLProjectPowerTools) installed
- An SDK-style SQL Database Project in your solution

### Running a Comparison

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click your SQL Database Project.

2. Select **SQL Project Power Tools > Visual Schema Compare (preview)...**

3. In the dialog that appears, enter the connection details for your database and choose the **comparison direction**:
   - **Database is source** – compares the live database against your project (useful for reverse-engineering changes made directly to the database)
   - **Project is source** – compares your project against the live database (useful before deployment)

4. Click **Compare**. The **Visual Schema Compare** tool window opens and populates with the results.

5. **Browse the differences.** Click any row in the grid to see the side-by-side T-SQL diff for that object.

6. When you are ready to act on the differences, click **Copy Deployment Script** to copy the DacFx-generated T-SQL deployment script to your clipboard.

## Benefits of SQL Database Project Power Tools

Visual Schema Compare is just one of the features in SQL Database Project Power Tools. The extension as a whole is designed to reduce friction in every stage of the database development lifecycle:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Import Database** | Bootstrap a new database project from an existing schema in seconds |
| **Visual Schema Compare** | Keep project and database in sync with a visual diff tool |
| **Static Code Analysis** | Catch design, naming, and performance issues before deployment |
| **E/R Diagrams** | Auto-generate Mermaid entity/relationship diagrams from your project |
| **Script Table Data** | Generate `MERGE` statements for seed data directly from live tables |
| **Scaffold Data API Builder** | Generate a Data API Builder configuration file from your project |
| **.dacpac Explorer** | Browse the contents of a `.dacpac` file in Solution Explorer |
| **Project Templates** | Quickly create new SQL database projects from ready-made templates |

Together, these features make SQL database projects a viable choice for teams that want to apply software engineering best practices — source control, code review, CI/CD — to their database schemas while enabling peformant, cross platform build and deployment processes.

## Acknowledgements

The Visual Schema Compare feature was inspired by the excellent [Database Schema Compare](https://github.com/Axial-SQL/AxialSqlTools/wiki/Database-Schema-Compare) feature in [Axial SQL Tools](https://github.com/Axial-SQL/AxialSqlTools). The concept of surfacing DacFx schema comparison inside a Visual Studio tool window, with a per-object T-SQL diff view and a deployment script tab, originated there. Many thanks to the Axial SQL Tools team for sharing the idea openly.
