Despite the age and soon complete [end of support in July 2021](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=SQL%20Server%20Compact%204.0) of SQL Server Compact 4 (launched in 2010), some (actually few) wonder if it is possible to use it with .NET Core. I will show how this can be done here.






``` csharp
var x = new string[];

```
